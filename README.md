# Analysis of data on glioma and neuron interactions
Key genes related to synapse formation between tumor cells and neurons were identified through multiple single-cell glioma datasets, and their association with prognosis was analyzed to explore the underlying mechanisms.

Processed snRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets are stored in the [/data ](https://github.com/silhouette99/Analysis_of_data_on_glioma_and_neuron_interactions/tree/main/data) dircetory. 

All key analysis scripts are available in the [/code](https://github.com/silhouette99/Analysis_of_data_on_glioma_and_neuron_interactions/tree/main/data) dircetory.

The definition and identification workflow for spiking cells described in Curry et al. is implemented using tools provided in the SCRAM framework, which is available at the following resource:
